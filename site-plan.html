        Welcome to my personal online portfolio. I am Matthew Kannapien, and I am a freshman at Brigham Young University-Idaho! I am currently majoring in Computer Information Technology. This is just something I made for fun :). Here, you can expect to learn more about me and my interests, hobbies, skills, and past life experiences. Nowhere else on the internet can you find any of this information all in one place. Once I get more qualifications this website will look a lot different, so enjoy this “vintage” website while it's here. Take a look around and perhaps learn something new about me, or just have a good time navigating around. Hope you are having a great day.

      <h3>About me/ Testimonials</h3>
      <p>
      
        I am from Spokane Valley Washington and currently in my second semester at Brigham Young University-Idaho. Before that, I spent 13  years learning and growing in the Washington State educational system, and two additional years on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Kentucky. Throughout the years I have had countless experiences that have and will continue to shape who I am today, just like you. I am currently majoring in Computer Information Technology, and it has been fun developing and learning skills with various systems so far. Aside from that, I love to be outdoors camping, cliff jumping, playing some spikeball and hiking with the dog. All in all, anything around friends and family is bound to be a good time. Currently learning how to build websites, so let me know of any feedback/compliments.
